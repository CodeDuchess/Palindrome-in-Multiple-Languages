This is an exercise to compare and contrast the differences in programming languages using common coding challenges. I have employed JavaScript, C#, Java and Ruby to see how the different languages can be utilized to simply determine if a word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwords as forwards.
